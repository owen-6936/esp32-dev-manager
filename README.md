## 📁 Project Structure

A high-level overview of the project's architecture:

````

src/
├── components/          \# Reusable UI components
├── store/               \# Zustand stores for state management
│   ├── component/
│   ├── journal/
│   ├── learning/
│   └── project/
├── types/               \# Type definitions and interfaces
│   ├── project/
│   └── shared/
└── ...                  \# Other files and assets

```

This structure follows a "feature-first" pattern, keeping related logic, types, and components organized.
